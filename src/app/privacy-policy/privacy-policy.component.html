      <li><strong><strong>Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</strong></strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>CalOPPA is the first state law to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law&rsquo;s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</p>

    <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>

    <p>0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;</p>

    <p>0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word &ldquo;Privacy&rdquo;, and can easily be found on the home page of our website;</p>

    <p>0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;</p>

    <p>0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at&nbsp;<strong><strong>seismicconsults@gmail.com</strong></strong>.</p>

    <p>Our Policy on &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; Signals:</p>

    <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.</p>

    <p>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.</p>

    <ol start="12">
      <li><strong><strong>Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</strong></strong></li>
    </ol>

If you choose to delete your personal information, you may not be able to use certain functions that require your personal information to operate.</strong></strong></p>

    <p><strong><strong>0.3. To stop selling your personal information. We don&rsquo;t sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. However, under some circumstances, a transfer of personal information to a third party, or within our family of companies, without monetary consideration may be considered a &ldquo;sale&rdquo; under </strong></strong><strong><strong>California </strong></strong><strong><strong>law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.</strong></strong></p>

    <p>If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers.</p>
